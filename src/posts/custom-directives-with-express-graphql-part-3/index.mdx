Till now we have the application structure fully setup.
Final code can be found here: [Link](https://github.com/pineapple45/custom-directives-with-express-graphql/tree/schema-splitting-part-3)

There are only 2 main things left:

1. Authentication
2. Authorisation

We will be using JWT authentication method for loging in the user.

### Choosing a wise logic for authentication & authorisation

If you have worked with REST API, it is easier to work implement both of the functionalities. We can just
create a middleware and apply the same middleware to each of the routes(_get_ requests) that we either want
to authenticate or on top of that authorize. But how will we implement that in graphql ? We have only a single
route 'http://whatever_host_url/graphql'. We are left with 2 choices.

1. Either attach a special property to each incoming request and then check in each of the resolver
   functions(users, posts, comments, likes) weather the resolver should fulfill the request or not!
2. Attatch custom resolver directly to each of our query , mutation or type definations in our graphql
   schema. Each custom resolver will have a seperate implementation logic where it will be checked weather
   the request should even reach the resolver or not?

Now both the methods can be used. But personally I would prefer to go with second one. I think this is
a good approach because this approach has quite a lot of benefits. The most visible ones are:

1. Code becomes much more modular. Write less code with same functionality!
2. Attatching a special property to each incoming request and then check where request should be
   fullfilled or not inside the resolver is cumbersome. As you can imagine when projects become larger, the resolvers
   will also increase. Managing logic for authentication/authorisation becomes really tedious and it may happen that
   you may forget adding this logic in some resolvers. The first approach is good enough for smaller projects.
3. Proved a REST like architecture. It kind of takes a middleware approach very similar to REST as you will
   see in a bit.

### Installing graphql-directive package

If you havent already, download the graphql-directive package.

```cmd
yarn add graphql-directive
// or
npm i graphql-directive
```

<Note
  note=" please not the version number for 'graphql' package and to specifically use this one
as I was having a couple of problems with newer version of 'graphql' package.
'graphql': '14.6.0'"
/>

### Adding types for graphql-directive package

Since no type are available for graphql-directive package that we installed, we create a graphql-directive.d.ts file in the root
with content as follows:

```ts
declare module "graphql-directive"
```

### Adding graphql-directive resolvers

folder structure is as follows:

```
-src
--graphql
---directives
----hasAuthorisation
----isAuthenticated
----upperCase
----index.ts
.
.
```

```ts
/* hasAuthorisation */
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken"

export const hasAuthorisation = async (
  resolve: any,
  directiveArgs: any,
  obj: any,
  context: any,
  info: any
) => {
  const authHeader = context.req.get("authorization")
  console.log(authHeader)
  if (authHeader === undefined || context.authHeader === "")
    throw new Error(`you are unauthenticated`)

  const token = authHeader.split(" ")[1]
  if (!token || token === "") throw new Error("Token not found or has expired")

  let decodedToken: any
  try {
    decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY as string)
  } catch (error: any) {
    if (!token || token === "") throw new Error(error)
  }

  if (!decodedToken) throw new Error("Token verification failed")

  // check authorisation roles here
  const roleToCheckFrom = obj && obj.roles
  if (roleToCheckFrom.indexOf(decodedToken.role) === -1)
    throw new Error("Not Authorised")
  return resolve()
}
```

```ts
/* isAuthenticated */
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken"

export const isAuthenticated = async (
  resolve: any,
  directiveArgs: any,
  obj: any,
  context: any,
  info: any
) => {
  // console.log(context.req);
  const authHeader = context.req.get("Authorization")
  console.log(authHeader)
  if (authHeader === undefined || context.authHeader === "")
    throw new Error(`you are unauthenticated`)

  const token = authHeader.split(" ")[1]
  if (!token || token === "") throw new Error("Token not found or has expired")

  let decodedToken: any
  try {
    decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY as string)
  } catch (error: any) {
    if (!token || token === "") throw new Error(error)
  }

  if (!decodedToken) throw new Error("Token verification failed")

  return resolve()
}
```

```ts
/* upperCase */
export const upperCase = async (
  resolve: any,
  directiveArgs: any,
  obj: any,
  context: any,
  info: any
) => {
  const value = await resolve()
  return String(value).toUpperCase()
}
```

<Note
  note="Note that @hasAuthorisation directive also covers the logic for @isAuthenticated. So while using 
the @hasAuthorisation directive, even if the user is the correctly authorised one, if user is not authenticated or 
as I should say the request header is empty, graphql will give error message of --not authenticated "
/>

```ts
/* ../graphql/directives/index.ts*/
export * from "./hasAuthorisation"
export * from "./isAuthenticated"
export * from "./upperCase"
```

### updating graphql-schema file to handle custom directives

```ts
import { buildSchema } from "graphql"
import { addDirectiveResolveFunctionsToSchema } from "graphql-directive"
import { upperCase, isAuthenticated, hasAuthorisation } from "../directives"

const schema = buildSchema(`

directive @upperCase on FIELD_DEFINITION | FIELD
directive @isAuthenticated on FIELD_DEFINITION | FIELD
directive @hasAuthorisation(roles: [Role!]) on FIELD_DEFINITION | FIELD

input PostInput {
    image: String
    title: String!
    description: String
    creatorId: ID!
}

type Post {
    _id: ID!
    image: String
    title: String!
    description: String
    creator: User!
    commentList: [Comment!]
    likeList: [Like!]
}

input CommentInput {
    text: String!
    postId: ID!
    creatorId: ID!
}

type Comment {
    _id: ID!
    text: String!
    post: Post!
    creator: User!
}

input LikeInput {
    postId: ID!
    creatorId: ID!
}

type Like {
    _id: ID!
    post: Post!
    creator: User!
}

enum Role {
    AUTH_USER
    ADMIN
    MODERATOR
}

input UserInput {
    username: String!
    email: String!
    password: String!
}

type User {
    _id: ID!
    username: String! @upperCase
    email: String!
    password: String
    role: Role!
    postList: [Post!]
    commentList: [Comment!]
    likeList: [Like!]
}

type AuthData {
    userId: ID!
    token: String!
    tokenExpiration: Int!
}

type RootQuery {
  listUsers: [User!] @hasAuthorisation(roles: [ADMIN])
  getUserById(_id: ID!): User!
  listPosts: [Post!]
  getPostById(_id: ID!): Post!
  listComments: [Comment!]
  getCommentById(_id: ID!): Comment!
  listLikes: [Like!]
  getLikeById(_id: ID!): Like!
  login(usernameOrEmail: String!, password: String!): AuthData!
}

type RootMutation {
  createUser(user: UserInput): User
  deleteUser(_id: ID!): String @hasAuthorisation(roles: [ADMIN])
  createPost(post: PostInput): Post @hasAuthorisation(roles: [ADMIN])
  deletePost(_id: ID!): String @hasAuthorisation(roles: [ADMIN,MODERATOR])
  createComment(comment: CommentInput): Comment
  deleteComment(_id: ID!): String @hasAuthorisation(roles: [ADMIN,MODERATOR])
  createLike(like: LikeInput): Like
  deleteLike(_id: ID!): String
  assignRole(role: String! , assignedBy: ID!, assignedUser: ID!): User @hasAuthorisation(roles: [ADMIN])
}

schema {
  query: RootQuery
  mutation: RootMutation
}
`)

addDirectiveResolveFunctionsToSchema(schema, {
  upperCase,
  isAuthenticated,
  hasAuthorisation,
})

export default schema
```

### updating entry src/index.ts file to pass graphql context to each of the directive-resolvers

```ts
import * as dotenv from "dotenv"
dotenv.config()
import cors from "cors"
import express, { Express, Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express"
import { graphqlHTTP } from "express-graphql"
import schema from "./graphql/schemas"
import rootResolver from "./graphql/resolvers"
import mongoose from "mongoose"
const app: Express = express()

app.use(cors())

app.use((req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST,GET,OPTIONS")
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, Authorization")
  if (req.method === "OPTIONS") {
    return res.sendStatus(200)
  }
  next()
})

app.use("/graphql", (req, res) => {
  return graphqlHTTP({
    schema: schema,
    rootValue: rootResolver,
    graphiql: true,
    context: { req, res }, // we pass context here which will be received by aur directive resolvers
  })(req, res)
})

const PORT =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
    ? process.env.PORT
    : process.env.PORT_DEV

const MONGO_URI = process.env.MONGO_URI as string

mongoose
  .connect(MONGO_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("connected to mongodb...")
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`server started on port ${PORT}`)
    })
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err)
  })
```

<Checkpoint
  checkpoint="The code till now can be found here"
  repoLink="https://github.com/pineapple45/custom-directives-with-express-graphql/tree/full-directives-implementation-part-3"
/>

Now let's test our custom directives. If you take a look at the updated schema, we have out directives placed
at a few different places.

As told above in the note, @hasAuthorisation directive also covers the logic for @isAuthenticated directive.
We will test the @hasAuthorisation for both authentication and authorisation.

<Note
  note="We cannot use graphiql tool for testing these directives since we need to pass headers along with
our requests which we want to be either authorised or authenticated. So we will use POSTMAN tool for this purpose.
The syntex for setting up queries in POSTMAN is a bit weird, So watch the video below carefully! "
/>

#### Testing the @isAuthenticated & @hasAuthorisation directive

First we will send no headers.We will try to list all users. In this case we should get **you are unauthenticated** error message as specified in our
@hasAuthorisation and @isAuthenticated custom-directive resolvers.

<Video
  videoSrcURL="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErVDtA_o92ZJoc9h_Ub7CoC5lEONl3_s/preview"
  title="@isAuthenticated-@hasAuthorisation"
/>

We get **you are unauthenticated** which means @isAuthenticated directive is correctly setup. It also means
that @hasAuthorisation directive is also correctly setup as long as authentication is concerned.

#### Testing @hasAuthorisation directive

Now we will take care of authorisation part in @hasAuthorisation. First we will log in. We get the Json Web Token.
Then we use the token and send it along the header and then our custom directive resolver handles authorisation. We currently have no user who is an
ADMIN or MODERATOR. So as per the schema and custom directives defined in it, if we try to get a list of all
users, we should get **Not Authorised**.

<Video
  videoSrcURL="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-GuqF2QQPC2N4V0ZknYwmuynvwxPn70F/preview"
  title="@hasAuthorisation"
/>

#### Testing the @upperCase directive

Now to test @upperCase directive, we need to get the list of all users since each username has to be shown in
uppercase as per our graphql schema. User's list can only be retrieved by an ADMIN. So I will manually
update the user role of any one of the user's in our mongodb database to ADMIN. Lets update role of **john doe** token
ADMIN:

<Video
  videoSrcURL="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JuIr-cC6LL5C07_NsToe2zZ5rebTpJKY/preview"
  title="@update_role_to_ADMIN"
/>

Now since role of user **john doe** is updated to ADMIN, john should be able to retrieve the list of users
successfully. We should also get usernames in uppercase which will confirm that our @upperCase directive is
working fine:

<Video
  videoSrcURL="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SqXxogME15UbnyfSZKGkkDcMARAToyXD/preview"
  title="@upperCase"
/>
So finally we get the response that we were looking for and hence this confirms that
our custom directives are working as they should....🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

### Splitting our graphql schema(optional)

Now our schema is getting a bit long. As the project grows, it is better to divide the schema
based on different sub-queries,sub-mutations or sub-subscriptions.
If you want to see how this is done a greater detail, watch this awesome video by ben awad: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XmQi80nFes)

### Updated directory structure for schemas folder

```
-src
--graphql
---schemas
----users.ts
----posts.ts
----comments.ts
----likes.ts
----index.ts
.
.
```

```ts
/* ../graphql/schemas/users.ts */
export const types = `

    commentList: [Comment!]
    likeList: [Like!]
} 

type AuthData {
    userId: ID!
    token: String!

  getLikeById(_id: ID!): Like!
`

export const mutations = `
createLike(like: LikeInput): Like
  deleteLike(_id: ID!): String
`

export const subscriptions = ``
```

```ts
/* ../graphql/schemas/index.ts */
//
import { buildSchema } from "graphql"
import { addDirectiveResolveFunctionsToSchema } from "graphql-directive"
import { upperCase, isAuthenticated, hasAuthorisation } from "../directives"

// import comparted schemas
import * as postsGQLSchema from "./posts"
import * as commentsGQLSchema from "./comments"
import * as likesGQLSchema from "./likes"
import * as usersGQLSchema from "./users"

const types: string[] = []
const queries: string[] = []
const mutations: string[] = []
const subscriptions = []
const schemas = [
  postsGQLSchema,
  commentsGQLSchema,
  likesGQLSchema,
  usersGQLSchema,
]

schemas.forEach(schema => {
  types.push(schema.types)
  queries.push(schema.queries)
  mutations.push(schema.mutations)
  subscriptions.push(schema.subscriptions)
})

const schema = buildSchema(`

directive @upperCase on FIELD_DEFINITION | FIELD
directive @isAuthenticated on FIELD_DEFINITION | FIELD
directive @hasAuthorisation(roles: [Role!]) on FIELD_DEFINITION | FIELD

enum Role {
    AUTH_USER
    ADMIN
    MODERATOR
}

${types.join("\n")}


type RootQuery {
    ${queries.join("\n")}
}

type RootMutation {
${mutations.join("\n")}
}

schema {
  query: RootQuery
  mutation: RootMutation
}
`)

addDirectiveResolveFunctionsToSchema(schema, {
  upperCase,
  isAuthenticated,
  hasAuthorisation,
})

export default schema
```

I will leave the original schema in a reference.ts file so as to later reference in case needed.
